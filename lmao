1) Turn Risk Radar into a real task list (biggest win)

Right now: you can snooze, but nothing is persisted. Staff will want: “what did we do about this?”

Add an Intervention Log:

action type: Email / Call / Meeting / Safeguarding / Referral

notes

status: Open / In progress / Resolved

follow-up date

who did it (staff_id)

Then change Risk Radar to:

show only “Open / due” items by default

include last action + last action date

allow “Resolve” button

Even if you don’t build a DB table yet, you can prototype with a simple table in Databricks.

2) Add “Explain why” and “What to do next” for each risk student

When staff select a student, show:

Attendance % (last progress)

Avg lateness (30d)

Low engagement count (30d)

Flags triggered ✅/❌

a short “Recommended action” text based on which flag is true

Example logic:

low attendance → “Send check-in + identify barriers”

lateness → “Agree transport plan / reminder”

low engagement → “1:1 conversation, adjust session role”

This makes the tool feel helpful, not just judgemental.

3) Add cohort + date range filters (so staff can focus)

Minimum additions:

cohort dropdown (based on staff’s cohorts)

date window: 14 / 30 / 60 days (affects risk query)

toggle: “Show snoozed” / “Hide snoozed”

These are tiny UX changes that massively improve day-to-day usage.

4) Student Journey should be a profile page, not only a timeline

Add a “Profile Summary” panel above the timeline:

age_band, employment_status_at_entry, education_level_at_entry

completion_status

latest progress scores (engagement/confidence/motivation/skills)

You already have the columns in participant + progress.

Also add “Last 30 days snapshot”:

sessions attended / total

avg lateness

most common participation level

most recent behaviour_notes (if present)

5) Add charts that answer “is this getting better?”

For a selected student:

attendance_rate_pct over time (from progress)

engagement_score over time (from progress)

For managers:

count of high-risk students over last 8 weeks

attendance rate by cohort

This turns the tool from a static list into something that supports planning.

6) Improve search: autocomplete + fuzzy lookup

Staff won’t remember exact participant codes.

Add:

search by participant_code OR partial match

optionally add a “search by cohort” list of participants

A simple query:

SELECT participant_code
FROM hackathon.emea.participant
WHERE participant_code LIKE ?
LIMIT 20


Then show a st.selectbox of matches.

7) “Lesson recommender” should support planning sessions

Right now it shows top 2 gaps per student, which is good, but staff also need:

“Top skills lacking in this city/cohort”

“Top recommended lesson plans this week”

filter by product_type / delivery_method / requires_equipment

This makes it usable for curriculum prep.

8) Timetable: add “prep checklist” and “kit required count”

Quick quality-of-life:

display a weekly view (today + next 7 days grouped by date)

show kit-required sessions count

show venue/location consistently

9) Add role-based views (coach vs manager)

You already have staff.role. Use it:

Coaches: Schedule + Risk + Student Journey

Managers: add Cohort Insights tab (attendance trends, risk counts, outcomes)
